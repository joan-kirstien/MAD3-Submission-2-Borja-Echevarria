# MAD3 Submission 2 - Borja,Echevarria

This repository contains the submission for MAD3 Assignment 2, developed collaboratively by Borja and Echevarria. Below is a breakdown of the tasks completed by each member.

## Contributions

### Borja:
- Created tasks 1, 2, and 7.
- Implemented the feature to show a summary card instead of displaying all the data upon fetching posts (`GET /posts`).
- Developed the functionality to display the details of a specific post through a modal or a separate screen (`GET /posts/{id}`).
- Ensured aesthetics and validation for inputs throughout the application.

### Echevarria:
- Completed tasks 3 to 6.
- Added the capability to create a new post and reflect it immediately in the overall list (`POST /posts`).
- Implemented the deletion of posts, simulating the removal in the UI without actual server updates.
- Faked the editing of posts (`PUT`), making it appear as though edits were saved in the UI without altering the server data.
